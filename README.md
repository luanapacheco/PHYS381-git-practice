# PHYS381-git-practice
getting started with git and github


The optional course "Introduction to Computational Physics with Python3" will introduce physics students who are beginning to study numerical methods to approaches to solving classical computational physics problems using the tools of the Python 3 programming language. Participants in the educational program will become familiar with Python 3 syntax, basic data structures, and control language constructs. They will learn to use matplotlib library tools to plot and visualize modeling results. They will independently implement tools and will also be able to use ready-made functions of the scipy library for numerical solution of linear, nonlinear, differential equations describing physical processes. Students will get acquainted with the interactive Jupyter Notebook shell.
1. This course offers an introduction to numerical methods in physics using the Python 3 programming language. Aimed at beginners, it covers Python syntax, basic data structures, and control flow. Students will learn use the matplotlib library for plotting and visualization of modeling results, and explore the scipy library to solve linear, nonlinear, and differential equations related to physical systems. The course emphasizes hands-on practice, including independent tool development and work within the interactive Jupyter Notebook environment.



Module 10. Damped oscillations of a pendulum. Multipliers.

- Obtain analytical solutions to an equation of damped oscillations taking into account the initial conditions.

- Solve the nonlinear equation numerically and compare the results with the nonlinear equation.

- Construct the amplitude-frequency characteristic A(w) of forced oscillations with friction for different damping coefficients.

Among the activities of this module, students have to create Python 3 functions, use various python modules, such as numpy, spicy. Students are also required to plot their data using pythonâ€™s  matplotlib and pyplot.
